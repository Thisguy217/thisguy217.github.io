    <h3>What is an ultrasound?</h3>
      <p>Ultrasound is a sound wave that is far beyond what any living organism can hear. It is used typically in medical imaging to help measure and see inside the body, while trying not to disrupt the organs that we take pictures of.</p>
    <h3>How is an ultrasound done?</h3>
      <p>Ultrasound is done by taking an instrument called a transducer, this object sends the ultrasound to the body, and depending on what the sound hits it will bounce back to the transducer. It changes depending on the type of tissue and fluid it hits, which is how we see the organs themsevles. The transducer takes the signal it recieves and sends it back to the computer and the computer(called a sonographer) performs some calculations on the sound signal and turns it into an image called a sonogram.</p>
      <h4>What is a sonogram? And what is a sonographer?</h4>
        <p class="info">A sonogram is the picture that comes from taking sound and turning it into a picture through a sonographer. It usually looks like a single color picture, like black and white! And a sonographer is how we do all the math and calculations in fractions of a second to be able to look inside the body!</p>
    <h3>Why do we use ultrasounds?</h3>
      <p>Ultrasounds are used to do all kinds of things! Everything from helping fix kidney and gall stones to taking pictures of little babies! Usually when a doctor wants to take an ultrasound they are trying to get pictures of what is happening inside your body and that way they do not have to do surgery just to help figure out what is wrong, or to just check up on a baby. It is super safe and helpful to do this!</p>
