			<li>Exekias while working on Achilles and Ajax playing Dice, a pottery piece, used black figure technique, psychology was explored, and had lots of open space.</li>
			<li>Doryphoros was the "Spear Bearer", it is known only for the copy however. Discobolos is similar, but a symbol of the Greek athlete, also only known from a copy of the Romans.</li>
			<li>Doric Columns: simple columns that tapered dramatically</li>
			<li>Ionic columns: more graceful looking columns that tapered slightly.</li>
			<li>Entablature: three part building: architrave, frieze, cornice.</li>
			<li>Metope:contained sculputred scenes on a building</li>
			<li>high relief: lots of 3d in a sculpture</li>
			<li>low relief: very little 3d in a sculpture</li>
			<li>entasis: columns that swell dramatically in the middle, as if they were bearing a ton of weight.</li>
			<li>Pediment:the triangle part of the frieze, containing a sculpture.</li>
			<li>peristyle: columns on all four sides of the buliding.</li>
			<li>limestone:widely available building material</li>
			<li>marble:scarce building material</li>
			<li>When Oedpis declares "None there is among you as sick as I" it is an example of hamartia.</li>
			<li>Rome won all three Punic Wars</li>
			<li>In short the biggest difference is the structure of the government or how it worked as a whole. In Republican Rome they had special leaders chosen that were elected and debated on function of government and would then be tossed up to the two main leaders to actually act. One functioned as a conqueror and the other functioned as a at home leader. Imperial Rome saw a change towards a single leader, an emporer, and the wars that would be fought were more of just a way to pay the military by having them conquer and pay themselves. I know that is super simplified but that is the jist of the differences between the two.</li>
			<li>the Roman Empire influenced the development of guilds, roads, agricultural imports/exports, and urbanization.</li>
			<p><em>My sweetest Lesbia, let us live and love;
				And though the sager sort our deeds reprove,
				Let us not weight them. Heaven's great lamps do dive
				Into their west, and straight again revive,
				But soon as once is set our little light,
				Then must we sleep one ever-during night.</em>-Catallus</p>
			<li>During the rule of Augustus, an avid supporter of the arts, he did not include any Christian art, because he died before Christ was Born.</li>
			<li>Cicero wrote to his friend Atticus that built the best understanding of Rome.</li>
			<li>Virgil dedicated <em>the Aeneid</em> to Emperor Augusts</li>
			<li>The future glory of Rome was the main theme of the <em>the Aeneid</em></li>
			<li>Romans were more fans of importing art than making it.</li>
			<li>Veristic style was trying to be true to the subject.</li>
			<li>Atraxia believed in skepticism, epicureanism, and skepticism</li>
			<li>Skepticism: no one can know anything. The four elements are organized rationally.</li>
			<li>Stoicism: everything obeys cause and effect. All elements are organized rationally.</li>
			<li>Epicureanism: the world is made of material, and there is nothing else. Death is not painless or painful. All elements are organized rationally.</li>
			<li>Romans really used arches and used them more with concrete.</li>
			<li>The Colosseum: Well the first obvious one is the Games held, usually fights, as well as spectacles of things like Christians and such, but another fact is Emperor Vespasian built it under the idea of "Panem et circus" bread and games. The other fact is it is one of the largest amphitheaters in the world.</li>
			<li>Roman Forum: 1. Built thanks to one of the earliest sewage systems
				2. The Tomb of Romulus is there!(Romes founded)
				3.It got the nickname Campo Vaccino after Rome fell</li>
			<li>Pantheon:1. From Greek "Honor All Gods"
				2.One of the best preserved monuments of Roman culture.
				3.It still has the April 21 lighting that celebrates the founding of Rome.</li>
