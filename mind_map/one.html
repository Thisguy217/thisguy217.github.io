			<li>Ancient Greek <em>poleis</em> had festivals and celebrations just for their polis. Polis were essentially city states and function independantly of each other.</li>
			<li>While Athens and Sparta shared much, such as a root language, they differed widly in many more ways. Some that I can recall is that Athens prioritized philosophy and the schools of thoughts (sometimes called cults) such as Pythagorus, Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle. Athens also was democratic, and relied on the votes of men with land to determine the course of the Polis as a whole. Contrary to this, Sparta utilized a king, and women were reverred and respected as well. Despite a majority of the society composing of slaves, training from a young age in the school encouraged violence and domination. This has even found a couple of renditions in the modern day films such as 300, and references in video games such as the Assassin's Creed franchise. These differences however, seem to be rooted in things such as the patron gods, Athens derived its name from Athena, and Sparta follows Artemis. Athena revered for wisdom permeated even into the soceity that grew around her temple. Artemis god of the hunt, as well as Ares being worshipped, probably gave rise to the Spartan soldier, which composed mostly of warriors and men ready to hunt and wage war. I would think though, part of how these two particular city-states behave though is also linked to certain links such as in cultural differences. Death was seen as a glorious end in Sparta, while in Athens enlightenment and knowledge gave light to a glorious legacy. So in other words, other than a language in common, Athens and Sparta were very different.</li>
			<li>Ancient Greece democracy was greatly influenced by Solon and Cleisthenes, while Pisistratus ruled as a tyrant. This has been the model for many modern governments.</li>
			<li>Ancient Greeks saw gods behave with human behaviour, sometimes worse than human, and it didn't help they families they were grouped into were so bad to each other.</li>
			<li>Agamemnon was King of Mycenae and Greek army General. If I recall the story he, being selfish, caused the Trojan war or made it last way longer than it needed to be, and did things pretty abusive or wrong to Achilles in the proccess.</li>
			<li>The Iliad was passed down in the pattern of dactylic hexameter, which was set up as 16 syllables with one unstress and two unstress that follow.</li>
			<li>Greek Music theory is there are doctrines of the nature of music, and the actual composition of music (or the how). The first explores what music does in society, both internally and externally, as well as its place in the infinite expanse of the universe. Various philosophers explored these ideas using things like poetry, math, and astronomy to explain or even connect ideas together. The how relied on a system of tetrachords that would generate the modern modal scales. This also included harmony and poetry, or heterophonic sounds and words being added.</li>
			<li>Music and astronomy were tightly linked together for some of the cults, such as Pythagoras, who felt that the orbits of the planets (from there observation) were in tune or sync with the same harmonies of the strings of a lyre. Such as an octave being 2:1, or 4:3 of a perfect 4th and 3:2 of a fith (if I recall correctly). Others, would argue that music and astronomy are the same coin, two sides, that are connected by underlying arithmetic.</li>
			<li>Combining all three ideas, music, poetry, and dancing would create telion melos, or perfect music. It Was the best way to invoke the blessings of the muses, as well as most pleasing to the gods. This was also something that if one was separated concerned philosphers such as Plato and Aristotle.</li>
			<li>Greek music was never given notation, it was mostly improv.</li>
			<li>Aulos was a reed instrument sometimes using two reeds (double reed) or even having two pipes. Lyre was a string instrument with around 6 to sometimes 11 strings. Apollo representing the lyre was usually very rythmic and strict, appearing to be the balance between chaos and rigidity. </li>
