    <h2>I am Thisguy217, I am an amatuer programmer but I like getting more skills!</h2>
    <p>Below are all my projects that I have uploaded. Each is unique and highlights specific points. I probably will make a mini blog to keep my HTML up to date. Hopefully soon I can also embed some of my other programs and I can actually make it a functioning website. Either way, enjoy!</p>
